    <h3 class="gradient-text">Security considerations</h3>

    <!-- --- The security considerations section --- -->

    <p>It is always recommended to always have the latest updates on any software that are run by the website. Having up to date software ensures security in a website since updates often deny exposure in the platform and provide additional security features. In the case that a website is not regularly updated, hackers will target that specific website due to its vulnerability. Whether the website uses services like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, or other content management systems (CMS) or even hand-coded files, the website administrators need to make sure that these programs and software keep up with modern technologies. Aside from that, having up to date software and services, assures that the load times stay minimal to none.<br>
      <br>
      Another detail that is important to mention is how the Cholleron Tearooms website is adviced to have extra care against Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. There needs to be ensurance that users cannon inject any active JavaScript content into any of the pages of the website. The way that a XSS attack works is that the hackers trick an application into sending malicious scripts through the website. Each time a user accesses any of those affected websites, they will automatically download the malicious scripts as if they were part of the website. In most cases, the user has his information stolen through the cookies that are sent and through the session tokens. It is moreover highly recommend for Chollerton Tearooms to ensure that their users use strong passwords in the scenario of a breach. Using multiple passwords gurantees that the users does not suffer from extreme loss of data, since most individuals keep the same password for all the services they use. (for example: e-mail addresses, bank accounts and social media accounts)</p>
